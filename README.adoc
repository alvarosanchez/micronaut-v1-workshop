=== Clone this repository

Once done, you can clone this repo:

----
git clone https://github.com/alvarosanchez/micronaut-workshop.git
----

NOTE: You will find each exercise's template files on each `exNN` folder. Solution is always inside a `solution` folder. To highlight the actions you actually need to perform, an icon is used: icon:hand-o-right[]

== Application architecture 

Throughout this workshop, we will be creating a football (soccer) management system.

ifdef::generate-diagrams[]
[plantuml, football-diagram, png]
....
together {
    node Fixtures
    database Mongo
}

together {
    node Clubs
    database H2
}

Clubs -> H2
H2 -[hidden]- Fixtures
Fixtures -> Mongo
Fixtures -> Clubs
....
endif::[]

image::football-diagram.png[]

* `clubs` is the microservice responsible for managing clubs. It uses GORM for
  Hibernate as a data access layer.
* `fixtures` manages all game fixtures, storing its data in MongoDB. For the 
  teams playing in a game, it doesn't store their full details, but rather their 
  ID. It has a service-discovery-enabled HTTP client to fetch club details from 
  the `clubs` microservice.

== Getting started with the Micronaut CLI (15 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `ex01` directory to work on this exercise

The Micronaut CLI is the recommended way to create new Micronaut projects. The 
CLI includes commands for generating specific categories of projects, allowing 
you to choose between build tools, test frameworks, and even pick the language 
you wish to use in your application. The CLI also provides commands for generating 
artifacts such as controllers, client interfaces, and serverless functions.

The `create-app` command is the starting point for creating Micronaut applications.
The CLI is based on the concept of **profiles**. A profile consist of a project
template (or skeleton), optional features, and profile-specific commands. Commands 
from a profile typically are specific to the profile application type; for example, 
the `service` profile (designed for creation of microservice applications) provides 
the `create-controller` and `create-client` commands.

=== Listing profiles (X minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] You can list the available profiles with the `list-profiles` command:

----
$ mn list-profiles                                                                                     
| Available Profiles
--------------------
* federation - The federation profile
* service - The service profile
* base - The base profile
----

TIP: The Micronaut team is actively working on new profiles, and eventually they 
will be available.

Applications generated from a profile can be personalised with **features**. A 
feature further customises the newly created project by adding additional 
dependencies to the build, more files to the project skeleton, etc.

=== Getting information about a profile (X minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] To see all the features of a profile, you can
use the `profile-info` command:

----
$ mn profile-info service

=== Creating and running a _hello galaxy_ (X minutes)

As explained avobe, the `create-app` command can be used to create new projects.
It accepts some flags:

.Create-App Flags
|===
|Flag|Description|Example

|`build`
|Build tool (one of `gradle`, `maven` - default is `gradle`)
|`-build maven`

|`profile`
|Profile to use for the project (default is `service`)
|`-profile function-aws`

|`features`
|Features to use for the project, comma-separated
|`-features security-jwt,mongo-gorm`

|`inplace`
|If present, generates the project in the current directory (project name is optional if this flag is set)
|`-inplace`
|===

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's create a _hello galaxy_ project:

----
$ mn create-app hello-galaxy -features groovy
| Application created at /private/tmp/hello-galaxy
----

WARNING: Currently, https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-profiles/issues/28[there is a bug]
in the CLI that makes it generate a main `Application.java` class regardless of 
the `groovy` feature being selected. However, the main `Application` class can be 
left as is, and we will work with Groovy with the rest of the project.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, move into the generated `hello-galaxy` folder and let's 
create a controller:

----
$ mn create-controller hello
| Rendered template Controller.groovy to destination src/main/groovy/hello/galaxy/HelloController.groovy
| Rendered template ControllerSpec.groovy to destination src/test/groovy/hello/galaxy/HelloControllerSpec.groovy
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Open the generated `HelloController.groovy` with your favourite 
IDE and make it return "Hello Micronauts!":

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex01/solution/hello-galaxy/src/main/groovy/hello/galaxy/HelloController.groovy[tag=action,indent=0]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, run the application:

    $ MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT=8080 ./gradlew run

TIP: Micronaut by default runs on a random port. This helps running multiple 
instances of a service. However, the port can be easily fixed by setting a
configuration variable, or simply by exposing an environment variable as we
did with `MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT=8080`

You will see a line similar to the following once the application has started

    14:40:01.187 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 957ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, on another shell, make a request to your service:

----
$ curl 0:8080/hello
Hello Galaxy!
----

=== Write an automated test (X minutes)

While testing manually is acceptable in some situations, going forward it is 
better to have automated tests to exercise our applications. Fortunately,
Micronaut makes testing super easy!

icon:hand-o-right[] Change the generated `src/test/groovy/hello/galaxy/HelloControllerSpec.groovy`
to look like this:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex01/solution/hello-galaxy/src/test/groovy/hello/galaxy/HelloControllerSpec.groovy[tag=spec]
----
<1> Running an embedded server
<2> Obtaining a reactive HTTP client attached to our embedded server
<3> As the client is non-blocking by default, we want to block in tests to make sure 
    we get a result before the test finishes. Also, the `retrieve` method returns
    the response as a String.

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, run the tests:

    ./gradlew test

Once finished, you should see an output similar to:

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s

== Creating the Clubs microservice (45 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `ex02/clubs` directory to work on this exercise. The project 
has been already created for you, no need to run `mn create-app` this time.

In this exercise we are creating the `clubs` microservice.

=== GORM layer (X minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's define first a `Club` domain class under
`src/main/groovy/clubs/domain/Club.groovy` with 2 string attributes:
`name` (mandatory) and `stadium` (optional).

WARNING: Unlike Grails, when using GORM in Micronaut you need to annotate your
entities with `grails.gorm.annotation.Entity`, as in Micronaut there is no
conventional folder such as `grails-app/domain`.

icon:hand-o-right[] Next, define a 
http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#dataServices[GORM data service]
named `ClubService` as an interface with the following operations:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/groovy/clubs/service/ClubService.groovy[tag=operations,indent=0]
----

TIP: GORM Data Services are annotated with `grails.gorm.services.Service`, taking
as an argument the entity they operate with. In this case, it would be `@Service(Club)`.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, let's test our service:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/test/groovy/clubs/ClubServiceSpec.groovy[tag=spec]
----
<1> `grails.gorm.transactions.Rollback` applies a transaction that always rolls back.
<2> Instead of any kind of injection, we simply get the bean from the application context.

=== REST API (X minutes)

Micronaut helps you writing both the client and server sides of a REST API. In this service,
we are going to create the following:

ifdef::generate-diagrams[]
[plantuml, clubs-diagram, png]
....
ClubsApi <<interface>>
ClubsClient <<interface>>

ClubsApi <|-- ClubsClient
ClubsApi <|-- ClubController

ClubsApi : @Get("/") List<Club> listClubs()
ClubsApi : @Get("/{id}") Club show(Long id)
....
endif::[]

image::clubs-diagram.png[]

icon:hand-o-right[] Create the `ClubsApi` interface, annotating its methods with 
`io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` as described in the diagram.

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, create `ClubsClient` by simply extending from `ClubsApi`.
Annotate the interface with `io.micronaut.http.client.Client("/")`.

icon:hand-o-right[] Finally, implement the controller `ClubController`. Annotate
the class with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller("/")`, matching the path
specified on `ClubsClient`. Use `ClubService` to implement the actions by declaring 
a constructor dependency on it.

WARNING: The controller actions need to be annotated with `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` again.

icon:hand-o-right[] Finally, configure `logback.xml` to see some relevant output

[source,xml]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/resources/logback.xml[tag=!default]
----
<1> Debug level for our code
<2> This allows to see the HTTP request and responses from the HTTP clients.

icon:hand-o-right[] Once you have it, write a test for everything:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/test/groovy/clubs/ClubControllerSpec.groovy[tag=spec]
----
<1> Wrap write operations with `grails.gorm.transactions.Transactional`

=== Load some data for production (X minutes)

During our tests, we have been seeding test data on demand, as it is a good
practise to isolate test data from test to test. However, for production, we 
want some data loaded

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's create a bean to load some data. Run:

    mn create-bean dataLoader

icon:hand-o-right[] Change it to look like:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/groovy/clubs/init/DataLoader.groovy[tag=class]
----
<1> `javax.inject.Singleton` will tell Micronaut to manage a single instance in 
    the application context.
<2> With `io.micronaut.context.annotation.Requires`, we ensure this runs on production, 
    which can be specified as not running under tests.
<3> Make the bean a `io.micronaut.context.event.ApplicationEventListener` of an
    `io.micronaut.runtime.server.event.ServerStartupEvent` event.
<4> Implement the method loading some sample data.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, run the application:

    ./gradlew run

You should see an output similar to:

    03:05:56.704 [main] DEBUG clubs.init.DataLoader - Loading sample data

=== Register the service in Consul (X minutes)

We want the `clubs` microservice to be discoverable by the `fixtures` service.
So we will enable Micronaut's Consul support for service discovery.

icon:hand-o-right[] First, add the neccessary dependency in `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/build.gradle[tag=dep,indent=0]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, change `src/main/resources/application.yml` to define
the Consul configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
include::./ex02/solution/clubs/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=consul]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Finally, run a Consul instance with Docker:

    $ docker run -d --name=dev-consul -e CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE=eth0 -e CONSUL_UI_BETA=true -p 8500:8500 consul

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, if you run the application, you will see it registers
with Consul at startup:

----
$ ./gradlew run
...
04:20:09.501 [nioEventLoopGroup-1-3] INFO  i.m.d.registration.AutoRegistration - Registered service [clubs] with Consul
...
----

icon:hand-o-right[] If you go the http://localhost:8500/[Consul UI], you can see
it shows as registered:

image::consul.png[]

icon:hand-o-right[] You can run yet another instance of `clubs` on a different
shell, and see it registered. We will use them both with Micronaut's load-balanced
HTTP client in the next exercise.

== Creating the Fixtures microservice (45 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `ex03/fixtures` directory to work on this exercise.

In this exercise we are creating the `fixtures` microservice.

=== GORM layer (X minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] First of all, run MongoDB with Docker:

    $ docker run -d --name=dev-mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo

We also need the `clubs` microservice running and registered in Consul. You can
run it directly from the `ex02/solution/clubs` folder:

    [ex02/solution/clubs] $ ./gradlew run

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, create the `Fixture` domain class with the following properties:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/groovy/fixtures/domain/Fixture.groovy[tag=fields,indent=0]
----

As you can see, we are only storing club's ids. When rendering fixture details,
we will use Micronaut's HTTP client to fetch details from the `clubs` microservice.

icon:hand-o-right[] The next thing we need is an HTTP client for the `clubs` microservice. Create one with:

    $ mn create-client clubs

Map the `GET /{clubId}` endpoint:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/groovy/fixtures/clubs/ClubsClient.groovy[tag=class]
----

We are using a reactive type in the HTTP client response, so that is a hint
for Micronaut to make it non-blocking.

icon:hand-o-right[] We also need a `Club` POGO, with 2 string fields: `name` and `stadium`.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now let's create a GORM Data Service for `Fixture` (named 
`FixtureService`). In this case, instead of an interface, we are using an abstract
class, as we are going to implement our own custom method.

First, define the operations that we want GORM to implement automatically:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/groovy/fixtures/service/FixtureService.groovy[tag=gorm-operations,indent=0]
----

As you can see, we are again using reactive types in the return values, and GORM will
figure out and implement it for us.

In this service, we need to transform `Fixture` instances into a data transfer 
object that contains club names and the stadium of the game. 

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's call this DTO `FixtureView` and add the following fields:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/groovy/fixtures/view/FixtureView.groovy[tag=fields,indent=0]
----

Then, in `FixtureService` we need to implement a method that takes a `Fixture` 
instance and converts it to a `FixtureView` instance. You first need to inject
the `ClubsClient` we defined before:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/groovy/fixtures/service/FixtureService.groovy[tag=client,indent=0]
----

Then, implement the method:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/groovy/fixtures/service/FixtureService.groovy[tag=to-view,indent=0]
----

As the HTTP client is non-blocking, we can retrieve details about both clubs in 
parallel, and then compose our response once we get both HTTP response.

=== REST API (X minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's create a controller for displaying fixtures:

    $ mn create-controller fixture

Declare a constructor dependency on `FixtureService` so that Micronaut knows it 
needs to be injected:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/groovy/fixtures/controller/FixtureController.groovy[tag=service,indent=0]
----

Then, implement the action:

[source,groovy]
----
include::./ex03/solution/fixtures/src/main/groovy/fixtures/controller/FixtureController.groovy[tag=service,indent=0]
----

=== Load some data for production (X minutes)

* DataLoader

=== See it in action (X minutes)
